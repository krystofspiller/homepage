Life of every individual is full of decisions. These range from small and inconsequential to monumental and life-changing. You’d be hard-pressed to find an individual who prefers to intentionally choose the worse decision. If you start exercising, you want to maximize the benefit you’re seeking, be it muscle growth, general health or not being out of breath from climbing few flights of stairs. If you buy something, be it food, clothes, electronics, you want to find the best deal according to your preferences which for most would be the most delicious, most comfortable and trendy, and most easy to use and cool items, respectively, for the lowest price. If you’re choosing a new school, new city or even new country, you want to have as much accurate information to make the best possible decision for yourself. Same goes for politicians you vote, the books you read, the health and career choices you make…

Imagine if you had an omniscient super smart and wise bestie who you fully trust, available to you at all times. Not only is your bestie smart and can easily recognize what is bullshit, what is legit, what to recommend or reject but it also needs to deliver it in a way that’s personable to you. Such a friend can tell you when you’re getting off-track, when you’re not getting the full context of something, this friend can hold you up to your best.

How would such a friend affect your daily life? Imagine a busy day which throws your way different kinds of events, data points, information.

8:45 - On your way to work, you hear a clip of [Elon Musk arguing that Democratic party uses Social Security Administration benefits to lure in illegal immigrants to the country which are then beholden to Democrats and overwhelmingly vote Democrat](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/musk-uses-immigration-claims-voter-fraud-sell-social-security-cuts-rcna196863). Your bestie responds saying that’s not what the data says, that illegal immigrants contribute more to the budget that they take and [majority votes Republican](https://www.cato.org/blog/naturalized-immigrants-probably-voted-republican-2024) so the argument doesn’t hold water.
