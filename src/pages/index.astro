        a change to the pricing packages where there was previously a single package
        and additional customer features were enabled on an ad-hoc basis and now
        there would be multiple packages with certain pre-enabled features.</SeeMore

            (RuboCop). Frontend one was about linting a stylistic error to
            follow our coding conventions (i.e. no more pointing it out in code
            reviews). In the backend, I made two linting rules which are a tad
            more complex:

                  >OpenAPI</span
                > helper enforcement</strong
              > - writing the OpenAPI specifications can be a bit cumbersome, there's
              a lot of boilerplate that needs to be written making bigger types hundreds
              of lines long. I wrote a helper to simplify this where majority of
              the use cases that previously took anywhere from 1 to 10 lines could
              now be reduced to a single line of code making it more readable. Converting
              the whole OpenAPI specification to use this helper would a large effort
              for an individual and there would still be the problem with my colleagues
              not being aware of this helper and writing new specifications without
              it. This linter rule therefore produced <span
                class="underline decoration-amber-400 decoration-wavy decoration-2 underline-offset-4"
                >warnings</span

                >errors</span
              > in some cases) to enforce its usage suggesting fellow colleagues
              to convert it to use the helper. The idea is that the <span
                class="underline decoration-amber-400 decoration-wavy decoration-2 underline-offset-4"
                >warnings</span

                >errors</span
              > once the conversion is complete so that it would be written in this
              more concise and readable format.

              became obsolete when the class was refactored or removed and could
              cause an issue. This linter rule checked that all strings that looked

          The OpenAPI specification was used to generate TypeScript types in the
          frontend. Since the OpenAPI specification was written by hand, there
          could be and were discrepancies between what was described in the
          OpenAPI schema and the actual shape of the response that the server
          returned. The idea of this initiative was to validate that the types
          in the frontend, that were generated from the OpenAPI specification
          manually defined in the backend, matched the actual response from the
          server and in the case it didn't match, report an error to Sentry
          which we used for frontend error tracking. As we didn't want to impose
          the cost of validating the types on every request in production, it
          was only enabled in our QA environment that we used often enough to
          catch majority of these errors.

          </ol>
          During the various stages, we have enforced this name both in CI as well
          as in Git commit hooks for faster feedback. At the last stage, where every
          change required a conventional commit message and happened on a branch
          called something like
          <span class="font-mono">feat/JIRA-123-optional-description</span> it became
          a bit tedious to always include <span class="font-mono"
            >feat(JIRA-123):</span
          >
          in the commit message. I wrote a commit message Git hook that took the
          type of the commit and scope (Jira ticket) from the branch name and formatted
          an otherwise plain message according to the conventional commit specification.
          Small time safer but mostly one less thing to think about.
